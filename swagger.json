This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme. For example, you might have a single \"Gold\" product that has prices for $100/month, $1000/year, and $50 once with the alternative billing cycle and pricing options each represented by a different plan and the recurring and one-time prices represented by different prices."},{"name":"Prices","description":"Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products.
